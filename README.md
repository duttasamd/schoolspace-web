### FOR DEVELOPERS

#### Conventions

1. Component/Renderable Function Names : `PascalCase [.jsx]`
2. Local Functions/ Instance Functions : `camelCase`
3. css/js files : `flatcase` [Exception : `App.css`, `Services/*.js`]
4. Constants : `CONSTANT_CASE`


Folders for each user type.  
Main screen files directly inside.  
Subfolders for Major Sub-Screens Types for the user type.

5. HTML/JS/CSS naming :
  * ids : `camelCase` [Start with the type of component. | TextBox id that accepts first name = `txtFirstName`]
  * classes : `flatcase` or `snake_case` [try to use classes that describe the css effects. Not the type of element. | centers element in flexbox = `flexcenter`]
  * vars : `camelCase` or `flatcase`. Explicit naming.
